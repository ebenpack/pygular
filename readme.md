# Pygular
A simple flask based regular expression editor/tester heavily inspired by [Rubular](http://www.rubular.com).

You can try it out [yonder](http://pygular.appspot.com/).

#TODO
* Flask-WTF
* Complete more rigorous testing.
* Fix wonkiness that shows up with certain expressions (e.g. "y?" or "()").
* Clear fields button
* Make permalink button?
* Submit button?
* Implement groups/backreferences.
* Possibly implement a replacement mode.
* (Long-term goal/pipe dream) Translate regexes into plain English, like [RegexBuddy](http://www.regexbuddy.com/).
* ~~Retain newlines in matched text.~~
* ~~Restructure/refactor. Move logic out of URL handler.~~
* ~~Setup app on GAE.~~
