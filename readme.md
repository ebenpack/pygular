# Pygular
A simple flask app heavily inspired by [Rubular](http://www.rubular.com).

#TODO
* Setup app on GAE.
* Implement groups/backreferences.
* Fix wonkiness that shows up with certain expressions (e.g. "y?" or "()")
* Complete more rigorous testing.
* Possibly implement a replacement mode.
* (Long-term goal/pipe dream) Translate regexes into plain English, like [RegexBuddy](http://www.regexbuddy.com/).
